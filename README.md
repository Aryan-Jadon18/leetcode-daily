# 🧮 LeetCode Daily

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is a collection of **daily LeetCode problem solutions, notes, and explanations**.  
The goal is to build consistency in problem-solving, track progress, and share approaches that help in mastering **data structures, algorithms, and coding interview preparation**.

Whether you’re a beginner starting out or an experienced developer brushing up on skills, this repo serves as a **daily journal of coding practice**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice **one problem a day** to build discipline.
- Document solutions with **clear explanations**.
- Explore multiple approaches (brute force, optimized, etc.).
- Create a reference library for interview prep.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **Daily Solutions:** Each day’s problem solution stored in its respective folder (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`).
- **Notes:** Explanations of approaches, complexity analysis, and key takeaways.
- **Resources:** Links to helpful guides, tutorials, and algorithm references.
